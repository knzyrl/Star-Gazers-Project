**User Stories:**

1. Alice is interested in seeing what the sky will look like tonight at their location. She inputs her coordinates and time and receives a star chart with those parameters. _(Team User Story)_
2. Bob would like to see the current phase of the moon so that they can plan stargazing activities. He uses the “Moon Phase” function and inputs his current location to receive an answer. _(Assigned to: Aryan)_
3. Alice would like to learn about upcoming celestial events that she can see from her location. She uses the “Events” function and inputs her current location to receive a list of events and dates. _(Assigned to: Cissy)_
4. Bob wants to see what the sky looked like during past events from anywhere in the world. He inputs precise coordinates and a time and receives a star chart according to those parameters. _(Assigned to: Alex)_
5. Alice wants to know the locations of nearby astronomical objects (asteroids, etc.) and if they may be viewed. She uses the “Near-Earth Objects” function and inputs her current location to receive a list of objects. _(Assigned to: Khangerel)_
6. Bob would like to be exposed to new and pretty pictures of space and learn fun facts about astronomical phenomena. This is achieved through the NASA APOD API which allows the user to generate a random astronomical image along with a short description. _(Assigned to: Erin)_
7. Alice does not know what her precise coordinates are. She uses the “Geocoding” function to convert her address into coordinates to use in the other functions. _(Assigned to: Cissy)_
8. **Extension**: Alice would like to receive explanations about visible planets and stars on the sky map so that they can gain more knowledge about astronomy.
