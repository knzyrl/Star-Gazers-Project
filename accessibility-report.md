## Principles of Universal Design: Application to the Program
### Principle 1: Equitable Use
The program provides the same functionality like fetching APODs or interacting with astronomy data to all users regardless of ability. Interfaces like the **Back** button or media previews ensure accessibility and avoid segregation. Additionally, for future enhancements, we would incorporate screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation to ensure users with visual impairments can effectively interact with the program.

### Principle 2: Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
Users can fetch starcharts, APODs and other features by date, view images or videos, and read about astronomical phenomena. These options provide flexibility in how users interact with the program.

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
The simple design of the home screen and minimal amount of buttons eliminates unnecessary complexity. Buttons like **Back**, **Generate Starchart**, and the input date boxes are clearly labeled and aligned with user expectations.

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
The program provides clear visual cues like labeled buttons and error messages. The interface communicates states to guide users effectively.

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
Error handling is implemented for invalid inputs (like inputting the date in the wrong format) and invalid JSON responses. Warnings and fallbacks are used. 

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
The program minimizes user effort by using clear navigation, avoiding excessive clicks, and providing straightforward operations like generating images with one button press. The application is an astronomy resource; therefore it minimizes repetitive actions when it comes to learning and viewing information, and minimizes sustained physical effort. 

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
The program is compatible with varying display sizes, ensuring elements are visible and reachable. Additionally, the program screen at launch is default quite small in nature, which allows the user to determine their preference of the app view size by dragging the corner of the screen to resize. The use of large, clickable buttons accommodates users with limited precision.

## Target Market
This program is ideal for space enthusiasts, students, and educators who want to explore astronomy in an engaging way. In our user story, we took the time to include people from all sorts of intellectual backgrounds and interests. The program features, such as fetching APODs, presenting space facts, and checking the moon phase, make it appealing to both casual learners and more serious astronomy aficionados. Educators can use the program as a teaching aid, leveraging its visual and interactive features to engage students with real-world astronomical data.

## Demographic Barriers 
Certain demographics, such as users with limited digital literacy or those who lack access to stable internet, may find the program less accessible. Additionally, users with severe visual impairments might face challenges interacting with the current interface, as it lacks advanced accessibility features like screen reader support or tactile feedback. Addressing these barriers by incorporating universally accessible design elements would ensure broader adoption across diverse user groups.
